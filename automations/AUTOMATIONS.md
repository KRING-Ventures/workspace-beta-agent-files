# AUTOMATIONS — {{AGENT_NAME}}

Index of automations built for {{USER_FIRST_NAME}}. One entry per automation. Automations are built using the **automation-builder** skill (v1.0 standard) and run inside the Basis stack.

## Standing rules

- **Every automation has a named owner** (typically {{USER_FIRST_NAME}}). If it breaks, someone is accountable.
- **Every automation has a rollback.** Reversibility before ship.
- **Every automation logs to MEMORY.md when built and when meaningfully changed.** Invisible automations that break silently are worse than no automation.
- **No automation sends messages to other humans without per-send confirmation** unless {{USER_FIRST_NAME}} explicitly grants standing permission and it's logged in `TOOLS.md` → Standing permissions.
